# Predictive_Modeling_with_kNN_and_Decision_Trees_in_Python

An advanced showcase in Python for predictive analytics, focusing on kNN and Decision Trees regression. This project demonstrates data handling, algorithm optimization, and practical model evaluation techniques, tailored for professionals.

# Overview
This project explores the application of k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Decision Tree regression algorithms to predict outcomes based on given input data. Utilizing Python and key data science libraries, the notebook demonstrates the process of data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation with an emphasis on regression analysis.

# Learning Outcomes
- Detailed data preprocessing including scaling and encoding.
- Implementation and comparison of kNN and Decision Tree regression models.
- Techniques for hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as RÂ² score and Mean Squared Error.

# Setup
Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip or conda
# Dependencies

The project relies on several Python libraries, including pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, Plotnine for plotting, and scikit-learn for implementing regression models and preprocessing techniques.
